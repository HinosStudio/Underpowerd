## Focus

Under-powered (*working title) is a survival game where you have to use the charge on your battery sparingly. You play as a robot trying to escape a facility through an escape pod that needs to be charged. The player can charge the escape pod with their own battery, but if the battery runs out of power they die. The player will have to find generators to charge their battery and transfer the charge their comfortable to part with to the escape pod. The player will have to travel, fight enemies, and open new pathways, which all will use up power on the battery.
